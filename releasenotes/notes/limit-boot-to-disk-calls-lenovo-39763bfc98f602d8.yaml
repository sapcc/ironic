    Fixes issues with Lenovo hardware where the system firmware may display
    a blue "Boot Option Restoration" screen after the agent writes an image
    to the host in UEFI boot mode, requiring manual intervention before the
    deployed node boots. This issue is rooted in multiple changes being made
    to the underlying NVRAM configuration of the node. Lenovo engineers
    have suggested to *only* change the UEFI NVRAM and not perform
    any further changes via the BMC to configure the next boot. Ironic now
    does such on Lenovo hardware. More information and background on this
    issue can be discovered in
    `bug 2053064 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2053064>`_.
