    Fixes an issue where a System Scoped user could not trigger a node into
    a ``manageable`` state with cleaning enabled, as the Neutron client would
    attempt to utilize their user's token to create the Neutron port for the
    cleaning operation, as designed. This is because with requests made in the
    ``system`` scope, there is no associated project and the request fails.

    Ironic now checks if the request has been made with a ``system`` scope,
    and if so it utilizes the internal credential configuration to communicate
    with Neutron.
